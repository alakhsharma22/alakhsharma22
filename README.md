- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alakhsharma22
I have experience in creating ML, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning models for various problems. 

I also have experience and interest in deriving and designing novel loss functions grounded in reinforcement learning and reasoning, specifically for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). 

Additionally, I have a strong interest in competitive programming.
